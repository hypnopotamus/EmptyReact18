## working
open this directory in visual studio code to start writing code.  You will likely be prompted to install some extensions that will make your life easier.  While in VS Code you can open a command line terminal (automatically at the root level of the code) by pressing ctrl + ~.

you'll find a default component in src/hello.jsx.  To see any components you add add them to src/index.jsx or to some other component that is already being rendered (index.jsx is the root level component).

hot reloading is enabled meaning that if you make change while the server is running they will be automatically incorporated and your browser updated
